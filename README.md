# Goodwe-SEMS-simple
Goal: Extract Solarpanel data from SEMS for Goodwe inverters.

Based:  on the works of https://github.com/markruys and https://github.com/dylian94 and http://euapi.sems.com.cn:82/swagger/ui/index SEMS API information.  Dylian developed a Domoticz solution for Goodwe inverters. 
See Mark Ruys for how to find the Goodwe powerStationId.
